WireGuard clients: managing VPN tunnels based on WireGuard

## About

This is an addon for Home Assistant. It allows to set up and manage Wireguard tunnels as a client. At the moment, Server functionality is not provided. 

After the tunnels are set up, they can be monitored through a web interface, which also provides suggestions to improve security and functionality.
